# Tic Tac Toe

Here lies the main template for the tic tac toe challenge!

Start by forking this repository, and then follow the instructions below.

To fork this repository, click the fork button on the top right of this page. Then, clone the forked repository to your local machine.

Then, install the dependencies and start the development server.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

We are using tailwind for styling, read more about it here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs

## The Challenge ðŸš€

Go to `./app/page.tsx` this is just a starting point for the challenge, you can change the layout, format, libaries as you see fit. As well, feel free to leverage all the latest and greatest of Generative AI (ChatGPT and etc.). We use these tools in our day-to-day work, so you should get to as well!

The goals are:

1. Make sure the players can take turns filling in the grid, no player can fill in a cell that is already filled.
2. Make sure the game can detect when a player wins or when the game is a tie. Display a message when that happens. (if you refresh, the game should reset)
3. Make sure the game follows the designs in the [figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/mbkGG6DYYBDfak6ToErWM1/Interview-Question?node-id=1-335&m=dev) (you can deviate a bit if you want to, but the closer the better)

**Spent a maximum of 2 hours on this task.** If you can't finish it in 2 hours, that's fine, just submit what you have. We are looking for thought process and code quality, not completion!

Good luck!

> If somehow you finish all the task above in 2 hours, and is bored... here's some additional "challenges" you can try:
>
> 1. Try and code an AI for the player 1 to play against!
> 2. Save the state in local storage (and add a reset button)
> 3. Add a score board for the players
> 4. Anything else comes to your mind!
>
> Just remember, the goal isnt to finish all the tasks, but to show your thought process and code quality. And most importantly, have fun! ðŸŽ‰ðŸš€

## Next Steps

Once you finish the challenge, push your code to your forked repository and send us the link to your repository. We will then have a 1 hour session where 30 minute will be spent on going through the code, and 30 minutes will be spent either pair programming or system design.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
